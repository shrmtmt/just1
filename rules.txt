"Just One" is a cooperative party game.

3 or more participants required.

One person becomes the "Guesser" and the others become "Clue givers".
A secret answer is given, and the "Guesser" can not look at the secret answer and the "Clue giver's clue".

The "Clue giver" thinks of a clue by which the guesser can guess the secret answer.
Clues must be a only one word.

Once all "Clue givers" have decided on a clue, the clue givers show their clues to each other except "Guesser".

If there are duplicate clues, those clues cannot be shown to the "Guesser".

Once the duplicate hints have been eliminated, the "Guesser" can see the remaining hints and guesses the secret answer.

If he/she cannot figure it out, he/she may show the duplicate hint or tell him/her the first letter of the clue. (It's a party game.)

When the guesser has finished answering, the guesser is switched to the next participant.

If there are just three participants, each "Clue giver" may give two clues each.
