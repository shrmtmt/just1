"Just One"🎉 is a fun game🃏 you play with friends. You need 3 or more people👨‍👩‍👧.

One person is the "Guesser"🤔. The others are "Clue Givers"🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♀️. There is a secret word🔒. The "Guesser" can't see this word.

"Clue Givers" think of one word💭. This word helps the "Guesser" guess the secret word.

After thinking, "Clue Givers" show their words to each other. But they do not show them to the "Guesser"🙈.

If two or more "Clue Givers" have the same word, they do not show this word🤐.

Then, it's the "Guesser's" turn to see the clue words.

The "Guesser" looks at these words and tries to guess the secret word 🧐.

Optional: If it's hard, the "Guesser" can get extra help😉. This can be a hidden word or the first letter of the secret word. Remember, it's just a party game🎈.

When the "Guesser" answers or gives up, the next person becomes the "Guesser"🔄.

With 3 people, each "Clue Giver" can give two words✌️.

If you play on a phone📱, use the "auto rotate" setting. It's better for the game👍.
