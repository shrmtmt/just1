"Just One"🎉 is a fun game🃏 you play with friends. You need 3 or more people👨‍👩‍👧.

One person is the "Guesser"🤔. The others are "Clue Givers"🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♀️. There is a "secret word"🔒. The "Guesser" can't see this word.

"Clue Givers" think of one word💭. This word helps the "Guesser" guess the secret word. After thinking, "Clue Givers" show their words to each other. But they do not show them to the "Guesser" yet🙈. If two or more "Clue Givers" have the same word, these clue can't be seen🤐.

Then, it's the "Guesser's" turn to see the clue words. The "Guesser" looks at these words and tries to guess the "secret word"🧐. When the "Guesser" answers or gives up, the next person becomes the "Guesser"🔄.
